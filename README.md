# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of different models to recommend whether they can be used to predict credit risk. 

## Results

![Random_Oversampling](Random_Oversampling.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.64

![Undersampling](Undersampling.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.56

![SMOTE](SMOTE.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.66

![SMOTEENN](SMOTEENN.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.65

![Balanced_Random_Forest](Balanced_Random_Forest.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.79

![Easy_Ensemble_AdaBoost](Easy_Ensemble_AdaBoost.png)
Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.93

## Summary
In the end, it was shown that the different models used all showed high incidences of false positives. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost seemed to be the best at predicting the low credit risks.
